== Basic notions
#definition[Topological Vector Space][
  A #strong[topological vector space] is a vector space $X$ over a topological field $ùïú$ equipped with a topology such that
  + the addition $+:X times X -> X$ is a continuous map,

  + the scalar multiplication $dot:ùïú times X->X$ is a continuous map.
]
We often write TVS for topological vector space.

#definition[Category of Topological Vector Spaces][
  The #strong[category of topological $ùïú$-vector spaces] is the category defined as follows:

  - Objects: topological $ùïú$-vector spaces,

  - Morphisms: continuous linear maps.

  This category is denoted by $sans("TVS")_ùïú$ or $ùïú"-"sans("TopVect")$.
]

Let $X$ be a topological vector space over a topological field $ùïú$. Then $X$ is a topological group with respect to the addition operation. And the topology on $X$ is completely determined by any neighborhood basis at 0.

#proposition[Topological Field Induces Topological Vector Space][
  Let $ùïú$ be a topological field and $V$ be a (merely algebraic) $ùïú$-vector space. Suppose
  $
    phi: V -->^(tilde) product_(i in I) ùïú
  $
  is a $k$-linear isomorphism. Then we can use $phi$ to define a topology on $V$ such that $U subset.eq V$ is open if and only if $phi(U)$ is open in $product_(i in I) ùïú$. Then $V$ is a topological vector space.
]


#definition[Absorb][
  Suppose $ùïú = RR "or" CC$. Let $X$ be a topological $ùïú$-vector space and $A$, $B$ be two subsets of $X$. We say $A$ #strong[absorb] $B$ if there exists a real number $r>0$ such that for any scalar $lambda in ùïú$ with $|lambda| > r$, we have
  $
    B subset.eq lambda A= {lambda x mid(|) x in A}.
  $
]

#definition[Absorbing Set][
  A subset $A$ of a vector space $V$ is called an #strong[absorbing set] if $A$ absorbs ${x}$ for every $x in V$. That is, for every $x in V$, there exists a real number $r>0$ such that for any scalar $lambda in ùïú$ with $|lambda| > r$, we have $x in lambda A$.
]


#definition[von Neumann Bounded Set][
  Suppose $ùïú = RR "or" CC$. Let $X$ be a topological $ùïú$-vector space. A subset $S$ of $X$ is called a #strong[von Neumann bounded set] if $S$ is absorbed by every neighborhood of $0$.
]<von-neumann-bounded-set>




=== Locally Convex Topological Vector Spaces

#definition[Balanced Set][
  Suppose $ùïú = RR "or" CC$. Let $X$ be a topological $ùïú$-vector space. A subset $A$ of $X$ is said to be #strong[balanced] if for every scalar $lambda in ùïú$ with $|lambda| <= 1$, we have
  $
    lambda A = {lambda x mid(|) x in A} subset.eq A.
  $
]<balanced-set>



#definition[Bounded Linear Operator][
  Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological vector spaces over $ùïú = bb(R) upright("or") bb(C)$. A #strong[bounded linear operator] from $X$ to $Y$ is a linear map $T:X -> Y$ that maps von Neumann bounded subsets of $X$ to von Neumann bounded subsets of $Y$.
]


#definition[Locally Convex Topological Vector Space][
  A topological vector space is called #strong[locally convex] if it has a neighborhood basis at $0$ consisting of balanced convex sets.
]
#remark[
  The category of locally convex topological vector spaces $sans("LCTVS")_ùïú$ is the full subcategory of $sans("TVS")_ùïú$ consisting of locally convex topological vector spaces.
]
#proposition[][
  Suppose that $V$ is a topological vector space. If $cal(B)$ is a collection of convex, #link(<balanced-set>)[balanced], and absorbing subsets of $V$, then the set of all positive scalar multiples of finite intersections of sets in $cal(B)$ forms a neighborhood basis at $0$. Thus $cal(B)$ defines a topology $tau$ on $V$. Furthermore, $(V, tau)$ is a locally convex topological vector space.

#definition[Seminorm][
  Given a vector space $X$ over $ùïú = bb(R) upright("or") bb(C)$. A *seminorm* on $X$ is a mapping $p : X arrow.r bb(R)$ which satisfies the following conditions:

  + (absolute homogeneity): $forall x in X , forall lambda in ùïú$, $p(lambda x)= abs(lambda) p(x)$,

  + (triangle inequality): $forall x , y in X$, $p(x + y) lt.eq p(x) + p(y)$.
]

#remark[
  We can show nonnegativity: $forall x in X$, $p(x) gt.eq 0$ and $p(x)=0$.
]

#definition[Seminorm-induced Pseudometric][
  Let $X$ be a vector space over $ùïú = bb(R) upright("or") bb(C)$ and $p:X -> RR$ be a seminorm on $X$. The #strong[seminorm-induced pseudometric] on $X$ is the function
  $
    d(x,y) = p(x-y),quad forall x,y in X.
  $
  The topology induced by this pseudometric is called the seminorm-induced topology on $X$.
]


#definition[Seminorm-induced Topology][
  Let $X$ be a vector space over $ùïú = bb(R) upright("or") bb(C)$ and $(p_alpha)_(alpha in A)$ be a family of seminorms on $X$. The #strong[seminorm-induced topology] on $X$ is the initial topology with respect to the family of seminorms $(p_alpha)_(alpha in A)$, i.e. the weakest topology on $X$ such that all seminorms $p_alpha:X -> RR$ are continuous.
]

#lemma[][
  Let $X$ be a vector space over $ùïú = bb(R) upright("or") bb(C)$ and $p$ is a family of seminorms on $X$. Then

    $
    is a convex subset of $X$.
  + For any $epsilon>0$,
    $
      B(0,epsilon) := {x in X mid(|) p (x) < epsilon}
    $
    is a balanced, and absorbing subset of $X$.
]
#proof[
  + Convexity: For any $x_1, x_2 in B(x_0,epsilon)$, for any $t in [0,1]$, we have
    $
      p(t x_1 + (1-t)x_2 - x_0) & = p(t (x_1 - x_0) + (1-t)(x_2 - x_0)) \
                                & <= t p(x_1 - x_0) + (1-t)p(x_2 - x_0) \
                                & < t epsilon + (1-t)epsilon            \
                                & = epsilon.
    $

  + - Balancedness: For any $lambda in ùïú$ with $|lambda| <= 1$, we have
      $
        p(lambda x) & = |lambda| p(x) \
                    & <= p(x)         \
                    & < epsilon,
      $
      which implies $lambda x in B(0,epsilon)$.

    - Absorbingness: For any $x in X$, we can take $r = p(x) / epsilon$. Then for any $lambda in ùïú$ with $|lambda| > r$, we have
      $
        p(1/lambda x) & = abs(1/lambda) p(x) \
                      & < p(x)/r             \
                      & = epsilon.
      $
      which implies $1/lambda x in B(0,epsilon)$. Thus $x=lambda (1/lambda x) in lambda B(0,epsilon)$.
]

#proposition[Properties of Seminorm-induced Topology][
  Let $X$ be a vector space over $ùïú = bb(R) upright("or") bb(C)$ and $(p_alpha)_(alpha in A)$ be a family of seminorms on $X$. Then

  + The topology on $X$ induced by $(p_alpha)_(alpha in A)$ is a locally convex topology.

  A topological vector space is called #strong[seminormable] if the topology of the space is induced from a single seminorm.

A locally convex topological vector space has a bounded neighborhood of 0 if and only if its topology can be defined by a single seminorm.

#proposition[Properties of Seminormable Spaces][

=== Fr√©chet Space

#definition[Fr√©chet Space][
  A #strong[Fr√©chet space] is a complete metrizable locally convex TVS.
]

#proposition[][
  A locally convex TVS is a Fr√©chet space if and only if it is metrizable by a complete translation-invariant metric.
]

#example[Weighted Sequence Space][
  Let $W_op("seq")$ be the linear space of all sequences of complex numbers. Then $W_op("seq")$ is a Fr√©chet space with the metric
  $
    d(x,y) = sum_(n=1)^oo 1 / (2^n) (|x_n - y_n|) / (1+|x_n-y_n|).
  $
  The convergence in this metric is equivalent to the convergence of each coordinate, i.e.
  $
    x^((k))=(x^((k))_1, x^((k))_2, x^((k))_3, dots.c ) --> x=(x_1,x_2,x_3,dots.c )
  $
  if and only if $x^((k))_n --> x_n$ for all $n in ZZ_(>=1)$.
]
#proof[
  First we show that $d$ is a metric. It is easy to see that $d$ is symmetric and positive definite. We need to show that $d$ satisfies the triangle inequality. Note the function $t |-> t/(1+t)$ is increasing on $[0,oo)$. For any $x,y,z in W_op("seq")$, we have
  $
    d(x,y) & = sum_(n=1)^oo 1 / (2^n) (|x_n - y_n|) / (1+|x_n-y_n|)                                                         \
           & = sum_(n=1)^oo 1 / (2^n) (|x_n - z_n|+|z_n-y_n|) / (1+|x_n - z_n|+|z_n-y_n|)                                   \
           & <= sum_(n=1)^oo 1 / (2^n) (|x_n - z_n|) / (1+|x_n-z_n|) + sum_(n=1)^oo 1 / (2^n) (|z_n - y_n|) / (1+|z_n-y_n|) \
           & = d(x,z) + d(z,y).
  $
  Next we show the equivalence of convergence. Suppose $lim_(n->oo) d(x^((k)),x) = 0$. Now fix $n in ZZ_(>=1)$. Then for any $epsilon > 0$, there exists $N in ZZ_(>=1)$ such that for all $k >= N$,
  $
    d(x^((k)),x) < 1 / (2^n) epsilon / (1+epsilon).
  $
  Thus by the monotonicity of the function $t |-> t/(1+t)$, we have
  $
    & 1 / (2^n) (|x^((k))_n - x_n|) / (1+|x^((k))_n-x_n|)<=d(x^((k)),x)< 1 / (2^n) epsilon / (1+epsilon)==> |x^((k))_n - x_n| < epsilon,
  $
  which implies $lim_(k->oo) x^((k))_n = x_n$.

  Conversely, suppose $lim_(k->oo) x^((k))_n = x_n$ for all $n in ZZ_(>=1)$. For any $epsilon > 0$, there exists $M in ZZ_(>=1)$ such that for all $n > M$,
  $
    sum_(m=n)^(oo) 1 / 2^m < epsilon.
  $

  For each $n in [1,M] inter ZZ$, pick $N_n in ZZ_(>=1)$ so that for all $k>= N_n$, $|x^((k))_n - x_n|<epsilon$. Let $N=max {M,N_1,dots.c,N_M}$. Note
  $
    t / (1+t)<=t,quad forall t in RR_(>=0).
  $
  For any $k >= N$,
  $
    d(x^((k)),x) &= sum_(n=1)^oo 1 / (2^n) (|x^((k))_n - x_n|) / (1+|x^((k))_n-x_n|)\
    &= sum_(n=1)^N 1 / (2^n) (|x^((k))_n - x_n|) / (1+|x^((k))_n-x_n|)+sum_(n=N+1)^oo 1 / (2^n) (|x^((k))_n - x_n|) / (1+|x^((k))_n-x_n|)\
    &<= sum_(n=1)^N 1 / (2^n) |x^((k))_n - x_n| + sum_(n=N+1)^oo 1 / (2^n) \
    &< sum_(n=1)^N epsilon / (2^n) + epsilon \
    &< 2 epsilon.
  $
  This implies $lim_(k->oo) d(x^((k)),x) = 0$. Thus the convergence in the metric $d$ is equivalent to the convergence of each coordinate.

  Finally, to prove completeness, let $(x^((k)))_(k>=1)$ be a Cauchy sequence in $d$. Then for any $epsilon>0$ and for each fixed $n$, there exists $M$ such that for all $j,l>= M$,
  $
    d(x^((l)),x^((j))) < 1 / (2^n) epsilon / (1+epsilon).
  $
  Since
  $
    1 / (2^n) (|x^((l))_n - x^((j))_n|) / (1+|x^((l))_n-x^((j))_n|) <= d(x^((l)),x^((j))) < 1 / (2^n) epsilon / (1+epsilon)==> |x^((l))_n - x^((j))_n| < epsilon,
  $
  we deduce that $(x^((k))_n)_(k>=1)$ is Cauchy in $CC$, hence converges to some $x_n$. Define $x=(x_n)$. The equivalence above yields
  $
    lim_(k->oo) d(x^((k)),x) = 0.
  $
  Therefore $W_op("seq")$ is complete. Combined with metrizability by $d$ and translation invariance, this shows $W_op("seq")$ is a Fr√©chet space.

#definition[Non-degenerate Bilinear Form][
  Let $X$ and $Y$ be vector spaces over a field $ùïú$. A #strong[non-degenerate bilinear form] on $X times Y$ is a bilinear map $b:X times Y -> ùïú$ satisfying the following two separation axioms:

  + $b(x,dot) = 0 ==> x = 0$, that is, $b(x,y) = 0$ for all $y in Y$ $==>$ $x = 0$,

  + $b(dot,y) = 0 ==> y = 0$, that is, $b(x,y) = 0$ for all $x in X$ $==>$ $y = 0$.

#definition[Dual Pairing][
  A #strong[dual pairing] over a field $bb(k)$ is a triple $(X, Y, b)$ where $X,Y$ is a $bb(k)$-vector space, and $b:X times Y -> bb(k)$ is a bilinear map which is non-degenerate.
]

#definition[Weak Topology with respect to a Pairing][
  Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological vector spaces over a field $bb(k)$ and $(X, Y, b)$ be a dual pairing. The #strong[weak topology on $X$] is the weakest topology on $X$ such that for any $y in Y$, the functional
  $
    X & --> bb(k)             \
    x & arrow.long.bar b(x,y)

  is continuous. The weak topology on $X$ is denoted by $tau(X, Y, b)$.

  Similarly, the #strong[weak topology on $Y$] is the weakest topology on $Y$ such that for any $x in X$, the functional
  $
    Y & --> bb(k)             \
    y & arrow.long.bar b(x,y)
  $
  is continuous. The weak topology on $Y$ is denoted by $tau(Y, X, b)$.
]

#proposition[Weak Topology can be Induced by a Family of Seminorms][
  Let $(X,Y,b)$ be a dual pairing. Then $(X,tau(X, Y, b))$ is a locally convex TVS and the weak topology on $X$ is determined by a family of seminorms $(p_y)_(y in Y)$ defined by
  $
    p_y: X & --> RR                   \
         x & arrow.long.bar |b(x,y)|.
  $
]<weak-topology-can-be-induced-by-a-family-of-seminorms>
#proof[
  First we show that for any $y in Y$, $p_y$ is a seminorm.

  + Triangle inequality. For any $x_1, x_2 in X$, we have
    $
      p_y(x_1+x_2)=abs(b(x_1 + x_2, y)) = abs(b(x_1, y) + b(x_2, y)) <= |b(x_1, y)| + abs(b(x_2, y)) = p_y (x_1) + p_y (x_2).
    $

  + Absolute homogeneity. For any $x in X$ and $lambda in ùïú$, we have
    $
      p_y (lambda x) = abs(b(lambda x, y)) = abs(lambda b(x, y)) = abs(lambda) abs(b(x, y)) = abs(lambda) p_y (x).
    $

  + Nonnegativity. For any $x in X$, we have
    $
      p_y (x) = abs(b(x, y)) >= 0.
    $

  Then we show that the weak topology on $X$ is determined by the family of seminorms $(p_y)_(y in Y)$.

#proof[
  Let $f:U -> bb(C)$ be a locally integrable function. Then for every compact subset $K subset.eq U$, the Lebesgue integral
  $
    integral_K |f(x)| dif x
  $
  is finite. Define a measure $mu$ on $U$ by
  $
    mu(A) = integral_A f(x) dif x

  for all Lebesgue measurable sets $A subset.eq U$. Then $mu$ is an absolutely continuous measure with density $f$.

  Conversely, let $mu$ be an absolutely continuous measure on $U$ with density $f$. Then for every compact subset $K subset.eq U$, the Lebesgue integral
  $
    integral_K |f(x)| dif x
  $
  is finite. Thus $f$ is locally integrable.

== Spaces of Test Functions

Recall that if ${p_i}_(i in I)$ is a family of seminorms on a vector space $X$, then *the topology generated by ${p_i}_(i in I)$* is the topology generated by the collection of sets
$
  {B(x_0,epsilon)_(i) in 2^X mid(|) i in I , x_0 in X, epsilon in RR_(>0)},
$
where
$
  B(x_0,epsilon)_(i) ={x in X mid(|) p_i (x-x_0) < epsilon}
$
is the open ball centered at $f$ with radius $epsilon$ with respect to the seminorm $p_i$.




#definition[Spaces of $C^k$-differentiable Functions on Open Sets][
  Let $U$ be an non-empty open subset of $bb(R)^d$. Suppose $k in ZZ_(>=0)union {oo}$. The #strong[space of $C^k$-continuous functions] $C^k (U)$ is the topological vector space consisting of all $k$-times continuously differentiable functions on $U$. For any non-empty compact subset of $K$ of $U$, any integer $m in ZZ$ with $0<=m<=k$ and any multi-index $alpha in ZZ_(>=0)^n$ with length $|alpha|<=m$, we can define seminorms
  $
    p_(alpha , K,1)(f) & =sup_(x in K) |partial^alpha f(x)|                  \

By the Riesz‚ÄìMarkov‚ÄìKakutani representation theorem, the space $C_c^0 (X)'$ can be identified with the space of Radon measures on $X$.

One particularly important class of Radon measures are those that are induced locally integrable functions. There is a bijective correspondence between locally integrable functions $f$ on $X$ and linear functionals $T_f$ on $C_c^0 (X)$ defined by
$
  T_f (g) = integral_X g f dif x,quad forall g in C_c^(oo) (X).

If $f$ and $g$ are locally integrable functions on $X$, then $T_f=T_g$ if and only if $f=g$ almost everywhere.

#definition[Weakly Integrable][
  Suppose $(X,Sigma, mu)$ is a measure space and $Y$ is a locally convex topological vector space over $ùïú = bb(R) upright("or") bb(C)$. A function $f:X -> Y$ is said to be *weakly integrable* if for any $phi in Y'$, we have
  $
    phi compose f in L^1 (X, Sigma, mu).
  $
  In this case, if there is a vector $y in Y$ such that for any $phi in Y'$,
  $
    integral_X phi compose f dif mu = phi (y),
  $
  then we say that $y$ is the *integral* of $f$ over $X$ and denote it by
  $
    integral_X f dif mu := y.
  $
]
#remark[
  If the integral of $f$ exists, then it is unique. Assume there are two vectors $y_1, y_2 in Y$ such that for any $phi in Y'$, we have
  $
    phi(y_1) = integral_X phi compose f dif mu = phi(y_2) ==>phi(y_1 - y_2) = 0.
  $
  Suppose $y_1 eq.not y_2$. Then $y_1 - y_2 != 0$. Since $Y$ is locally convex, we know continuous linear functionals separate points. So we can find $psi in Y'$ with $psi(y_1 - y_2) != 0$, contradicting
  $
    phi(y_1 - y_2) = 0, quad forall phi in Y'.

  Hence $y_1 = y_2$.

  - The function $T compose f:X -> Z$ is weakly integrable.

  - The integral of $T compose f$ exists and is given by
  $
    integral_X T compose f dif mu = T(integral_X f dif mu).
  $
]
#proof[
  Given any $phi.alt in Z'$, since $T$ is coutinous, we have $phi.alt compose T in Y'$. Since $f:X->Y$ is weakly integrable, we have
  $
    phi.alt compose (T compose f)=(phi.alt compose T) compose f in L^1 (X, Sigma, mu),
  $
  which implies that $T compose f$ is weakly integrable. Furthermore, define
  $
    z:=T(integral_X f dif mu).
  $
  For any $phi.alt in Z'$, we have
  $
    phi.alt(z) = phi.alt(T(integral_X f dif mu)) = (phi.alt compose T)(integral_X f dif mu) = integral_X (phi.alt compose T) compose f dif mu = integral_X phi.alt compose (T compose f) dif mu.

  Thus the integral of $T compose f$ exists and is equal to $z$.

  First we show that the quotient norm is well-defined. Given $x_1, x_2 in X$ such that $x_1 + N = x_2 + N$, we have $x_1 - x_2 in N$. Therefore,

For classical functional analysis, we mainly focus on the following two types of $L^p$ spaces.

#example[$L^p lr((E))$ spaces ][
  The first type is defined on some sub measure space $E$ of the Lebesgue measure space $lr((bb(R)^n , cal(M) , mu_(cal(M))))$, written as $L^p lr((E))$ spaces. In this case, the underlying set of $L^p lr((E))$ consists all measurable functions $f$ such that $||f||_p < oo$ where
  $
    bar.v.double dot.op bar.v.double_p : {f:E->CC mid(|) f upright("is measurable")} --> lr([0 , oo])
  $
  is a map defined as
  $
    norm(f)_p ‚âî cases(
      (integral_E |f|^p dif x)^(1/p)\, & quad 1 <= p < infinity \
      , #h(0em)
      inf thin lr({M: |f| <= M "a.e."})\,& quad p = infinity
    )
  $
  The norm of $L^p lr((E))$ is just the restriction of $bar.v.double dot.op bar.v.double_p$ to the underlying set of $L^p lr((E))$. Strictly speaking, measurable functions in $L^p lr((E))$ should quotient out the equivalent relation $=^(a.e.)$.
]

#example[$ell^p$ spaces][
  The second type is defined on $lr((bb(N) , 2^(bb(N)) , mu_c))$ where $2^(bb(N))$ is the power set of $bb(N)$ and $mu_c$ is the counting measure
  $
    mu_c lr((A)) = cases(
      delim: "{",
      lr(|A|) & upright(" if ") A upright(" is finite")\,,
      , oo & upright(" if ") A upright(" is infinite").
    )
  $
  $L^p lr((bb(N) , cal(P) lr((bb(N))) , mu_c))$ are often written as $ell^p$. In this case, the underlying set of $ell^p$ consists all real number sequences $x = lr((x_1 , x_2 , dots.h.c))$ such that $||x||_p < oo$ where $bar.v.double dot.op bar.v.double_p : bb(R)^(bb(N)) arrow.r lr([0 , oo])$ is defined as $ ||x||_p := cases(

#proposition[Absolutely Convergent Series is Unconditionally Convergent][
  Let $X$ be a Banach space and $(x_k)_(k=1)^n$ be a sequence in $X$. If the series $limits(sum)_(k=1)^(oo) x_k$ is absolutely convergent, then it is unconditionally convergent.
]
#proof[
  If the series $limits(sum)_(k=1)^(oo) x_k$ is absolutely convergent, then the series $limits(sum)_(k=1)^(oo) ||x_k||$ is convergent in $bb(R)$. Since convergence in $bb(R)$ is Cauchy sequence, the sequence of partial sums $S_n=limits(sum)_(k=1)^(n) ||x_k||$ is a Cauchy sequence. Therefore, for any $epsilon > 0$, there exists $N in ZZ_(>=0)$ such that for all $n >= m > N$,
  $
    |S_n - S_m| < epsilon.
  $
  Let $T_n=limits(sum)_(k=1)^(n) x_k$. Then for any $epsilon > 0$, there exists $N in ZZ_(>=0)$ such that for all $n >= m > N$,
  $
    norm(T_n - T_m) = norm(limits(sum)_(k=m+1)^n x_k) <= sum_(k=m+1)^n norm(x_k) =|S_n - S_m|< epsilon.
  $
  This means the sequence $(T_n)_(n=1)^(oo)$ is a Cauchy sequence. Since $X$ is a Banach space, $(T_n)_(n=1)^(oo)$ is convergent.

  To show the series $limits(sum)_(k=1)^(oo) x_k$ is unconditionally convergent, we need to show that for any bijection $sigma: ZZ_(>=1)-->^(tilde) ZZ_(>=1)$, the series $limits(sum)_(k=1)^(oo^(#v(1.3em))) x_(sigma(k))$ is convergent and its limit is the same as the limit of the original series. // Hack: #v(1.3em) is used to adjust the vertical spacing between oo and the exponent.

  Given $epsilon > 0$, there exists $N in ZZ_(>=1)$ such that for all $n > N$, we have
  $
    sum_(k=N+1)^oo norm(x_k) < epsilon / 2
  $
  and
  $
    norm(limits(sum)_(k=1)^(N) x_(k) - limits(sum)_(k=1)^(oo) x_k) < epsilon / 2.
  $
  Suppose $M$ is an integer such that ${1, 2, dots, N} subset.eq {sigma(1), sigma(2), dots, sigma(M)}$. Then
  $
    norm(limits(sum)_(k=1)^(M) x_(sigma(k)) - limits(sum)_(k=1)^(N) x_k) &=norm(sum_(k in {sigma(1), dots, sigma(M)}-{1, dots, N}) x_k) \
    &<= sum_(k in {sigma(1), dots, sigma(M)}-{1, dots, N}) norm(x_k)\
    & <= sum_(k=N+1)^oo norm(x_k) \
    & < epsilon / 2.
  $
  Note for any $n > M$, we still have ${1, 2, dots, N} subset.eq {sigma(1), sigma(2), dots, sigma(n)}$. Therefore, for any $n > M$, we have
  $
    norm(limits(sum)_(k=1)^(n) x_(sigma(k)) - limits(sum)_(k=1)^(oo) x_k) <= norm(limits(sum)_(k=1)^(n) x_(sigma(k)) - limits(sum)_(k=1)^(N) x_k)+ norm(limits(sum)_(k=1)^(N) x_k - limits(sum)_(k=1)^(oo) x_k) < epsilon / 2 + epsilon / 2 = epsilon.
  $
  This proves the series $limits(sum)_(k=1)^(oo) x_(sigma(k))$ is convergent and its limit is the same as the limit of the original series.

  Let $X$ be a Banach space and $(x_k)_(k=1)^(oo)$ be a sequence in $X$. If there exists a sequence $(a_k)_(k=1)^(oo)$ of nonnegative real numbers such that

  $
  and the series $limits(sum)_(k=1)^(oo) a_k$ converges, then the series $limits(sum)_(k=1)^(oo) x_k$ is absolutely convergent.
]<Banach-spaces-comparison-test>
#proof[
  Applying the comparison test for series of nonnegative real numbers, we see $limits(sum)_(k=1)^(oo) norm(x_k)$ is convergent. Therefore, the series $limits(sum)_(k=1)^(oo) x_k$ is absolutely convergent.

  Let $H$ be a Hilbert space and $M subset.eq H$ be a closed convex subset of $H$. Then for any $x in H$, there exists a unique $x_0 in M$ such that
  $
    norm(x - x_0)_H = inf_(y in M) norm(x - y)_H.
  $
]
#proof[
  Denote $d:=inf_(y in M) norm(x - y)_H$.
  - *Existence*: For any $x in H$, we can find a sequence $(y_n)_(n=1)^(oo)$ in $M$ such that
    $
      lim_(n-> oo) norm(x - y_n)_H = d.
    $
    Next we show that the sequence $(y_n)_(n=1)^(oo)$ is Cauchy. By parallelogram law, we have
    $
      norm((y_m - x )+ (y_n - x))_H^2 + norm(y_m - y_n)_H^2 = 2 norm(y_m - x)_H^2 + 2 norm(y_n- x)_H^2 ,
    $
    which implies
    $
      norm(y_m - y_n)_H^2 & = 2 norm(y_m - x)_H^2 + 2 norm(y_n - x)_H^2 - norm((y_m - x )+ (y_n - x))_H^2 \
                          & = 2 norm(y_m - x)_H^2 + 2 norm(y_n - x)_H^2 - 4 norm((y_m+y_n)/2 - x)_H^2 .
    $
    Since $M$ is convex, we have
    $
      (y_m + y_n)/2 in M ==> norm((y_m+y_n)/2 - x)_H^2>= d.
    $
    Therefore, we have
    $
      norm(y_m - y_n)_H^2 <= 2 norm(y_m - x)_H^2 + 2 norm(y_n - x)_H^2 - 4 d^2.
    $
    For any $epsilon > 0$, there exists $N in ZZ_(>=1)$ such that for all $n> N$,
    $
      abs(norm(y_n - x)_H^2 - d^2) < epsilon^2 / 4.
    $
    In particular, for all $m, n > N$, we have
    $
      norm(y_m - x)_H^2 <= d^2 + epsilon^2 / 4, quad norm(y_n - x)_H^2 <= d^2 + epsilon^2 / 4.
    $
    Thus we get
    $
      norm(y_m - y_n)_H^2 <= 2 (d^2 + epsilon^2 / 4) + 2 (d^2 + epsilon^2 / 4) - 4 d^2 = epsilon^2==> norm(y_m - y_n)_H <= epsilon,
    $
    which shows that $(y_n)_(n=1)^(oo)$ is a Cauchy sequence. Since $H$ is complete, $(y_n)_(n=1)^(oo)$ is convergent. Take
    $
      x_0 = lim_(n-> oo) y_n
    $
    Since $M$ is closed, we have $x_0 in M$ and
    $

#proposition[Orthogonal Decomposition Theorem][
  Let $H$ be a Hilbert space. Let $M$ be a closed linear subspace of $H$. Then we have
  $
    H = M plus.circle M^perp.
  $
]
#proof[
  For any $x in H$, we can find a unique $x_0 in M$ such that
  $
    norm(x - x_0)_H = inf_(y in M) norm(x - y)_H.
  $
  By @orthogonal-decomposition-lemma, we have $(x - x_0) perp M$. Therefore, we can write
  $
    x = x_0 + (x - x_0).
  $
  Since $M$ is closed, we have $x_0 in M$ and $x - x_0 in M^perp$. This shows that every element of $H$ can be written as a sum of an element in $M$ and an element in $M^perp$.

  Suppose there exists another decomposition
  $
    x= x_0 + (x - x_0)= y + z
  $
  where $y in M$ and $z in M^perp$. On the one hand, we have $y - x_0 in M$. On the other hand, we have
  $
    y - x_0 = (x-x_0) - z in M^perp.
  $
  Thus there must be $y-x_0=0$. This implies $y=x_0$ and $z=x-x_0$. This shows that the decomposition is unique.

#proposition[][
  Let $H$ be an inner product space over $ùïú = RR upright("or") CC$. Then for any $y in H$, the map
  $
    f:=angle.l dot , y angle.r : H & --> CC                     \
                                 x & --> angle.l x \, y angle.r
  $
  is a bounded linear functional on $H$. And we have $norm(f)_(op("op")) = norm(y)_H$.
]<inner-product-as-functional>


#proof[
  By the definition of inner product, we see that $f$ is linear. For any $x in H$, we have
  $
    |f(x)| = |angle.l x \, y angle.r| <= norm(x)_H norm(y)_H.
  $
  Therefore, $f$ is a bounded linear functional on $H$ and $norm(f)_(op("op")) <= norm(y)_H$.

  - If $y=0$, then $f(x)=0$ for all $x in H$, so $norm(f)_(op("op")) = 0 = norm(y)_H$.

  - If $y eq.not 0$, then we can take $y_0=y/norm(y)_H$. So we have $norm(y_0)_H = 1$ and
    $
      abs(f(y_0))=1/norm(y)_H abs(f(y)) =1/norm(y)_H angle.l y\, y angle.r= norm(y)_H,
    $
    which implies $norm(f)_(op("op")) >= norm(y)_H$. Therefore, we have $norm(f)_(op("op")) = norm(y)_H$.

If $H$ is a Hilbert space, then the converse
of the above proposition holds, which is known as the Riesz representation theorem.

#theorem[Riesz Representation Theorem][
  Let $H$ be a Hilbert space over $ùïú = RR upright("or") CC$. Then for any bounded linear functional $f:H -> ùïú$, there exists a unique $y in H$ such that
  $
    f(x) = angle.l x \, y angle.r, quad forall x in H.
  $
  Furthermore, we have $norm(f)_(op("op")) = norm(y)_H$.
]<riesz-representation-theorem>
#proof[
  Let $f$ be a bounded linear functional on $H$. If $f=0$, then we can take $y=0$ and the theorem holds trivially. If $f eq.not 0$, let $M = ker (f)$ be the kernel of $f$. Then $M$ is a closed subspace of $H$. By @orthogonal-decomposition-lemma, we have
  $
    H = M plus.circle M^perp.
  $
  Since $f eq.not 0$, we have $M=ker f eq.not H$, which implies $M$ is not dense in $H$. By @orthogonal-complementation-properties, we have $M^perp eq.not {0}$. Therefore, we can choose a $z in M^perp$ such that $norm(z)_H = 1$. Since $M inter M^perp={0}$, we see $z in.not M$ and accordingly $f(z) eq.not 0$. Now we can take
  $
    y = overline(f(z)) z in M^perp.
  $
  Note for any $x in H$,
  $
    f(f(x)/f(z) z -x)= f(x)/f(z) f(z) - f(x) = 0==> f(x)/f(z) z -x in M.
  $
  We can check that for any $x in H$,
  $
    f(x) & = f(x) angle.l z \, z angle.r                                         \
         & = f(x)/f(z) f(z ) angle.l z \, z angle.r                              \
         & = lr(angle.l f(x)/f(z) z \, overline(f(z)) z angle.r)                 \
         & = lr(angle.l f(x)/f(z) z -x \, y angle.r) +lr(angle.l x \, y angle.r) \
         & = angle.l x \, y angle.r.
  $
  To show the uniqueness of $y$, suppose there exists another $y' in H$ such that
  $
    f(x) = angle.l x \, y' angle.r, quad forall x in H.
  $
  Then we have
  $
    angle.l x \, y - y' angle.r = f(x) - f(x) = 0, quad forall x in H.
  $
  This means $y - y'=0$ and therefore $y = y'$.
  Finally, by @inner-product-as-functional, we have $norm(f)_(op("op")) = norm(y)_H$.

]<Banach-spaces-invertibility-1-x>
#proof[
  From $norm(x)<1$ we have
  $
    sum_(n=0)^(oo) norm(x)^n = 1 / (1-norm(x)) < oo.
  $
  For any $n in ZZ_(>=0)$, we have $norm(x^n) <= norm(x)^n$. Thus by #link(<Banach-spaces-comparison-test>)[comparison test for series], the series $limits(sum)_(n=0)^(oo) x^n$ is absolutely convergent. Note
  $
    lim_(n arrow.r oo) norm(x^n) <= lim_(n arrow.r oo) norm(x)^n = 0 ==> lim_(n arrow.r oo) x^n = 0.

    we have

      (1_A - 1 / lambda x)^(-1) = limits(sum)_(n=0)^(oo) (1 / lambda x)^n.

  + The map $eta$ is injective since $x^(-1) = y^(-1)$ implies $x = y$. Since $eta$ is also surjective, it is a bijection. To show continuity of $eta$, consider a point $x in A^(times)$ and a sequence $(x_n)_(n=1)^(oo)$ in $A^(times)$ such that $x_n arrow x$. We need to show $x_n^(-1) arrow x^(-1)$ in $A$. For sufficiently large $n$, we have $norm(x_n - x) < 1/2 norm(x^(-1))^(-1)$. From (i) we obtain
    $
      norm(x_n^(-1) - x^(-1))=norm((x-(x-x_n))^(-1) - x^(-1)) <= 2 norm(x^(-1))^2 norm(x_n - x) .

#definition[Spectrum of a Commutative Unital Banach Algebra][
  Let $A$ be a commutative unital Banach algebra. A *multiplicative
  functional* on $A$ is a nonzero Banach algebra homomorphism $h:A -> CC$. The set of all multiplicative functionals on $A$ is called the *spectrum* of $A$ and is denoted by $sigma(A)$.

#proposition[][
  Let $A$ be a commutative unital Banach algebra and $h in sigma(A)$. Then we have

  + $h(1_A) = 1$.

  + $h$ is surjective.

  + If $x in A^(times)$, then $h(x) in CC^(times)$.

  + For any $x in A$, $abs(h(x)) <= norm(x)$. So the operator norm of $h$
    $

    $
]<properties-of-multiplicative-functionals>
#proof[
  + Since $h eq.not 0$, there exists $x in A$ such that $h(x) eq.not 0$. Then $h(x) = h(1_A x) = h(1_A) h(x)$. So we have $h(1_A) = 1$.

  + For any $lambda in CC$, $h(lambda 1_A) = lambda h(1_A) = lambda$. So $h$ is surjective.

  + If $x in A^(times)$, then $h(x^(-1))h(x)=h(x^(-1) x)=h(1_A)=1$. So we have $h(x)in CC^(times)$.

  + Suppose there exists $a in A$ such that $|h(a)| > norm(a)$. According to @neumann-series, $h(a)1_A - a$ is invertible. Then by (ii) we have
    $
      h(h(a)1_A - a) = h(a)h(1_A) - h(a) = h(a) - h(a) = 0 in CC^(times),

#proposition[Spectrum is Compact Hausdorff][
  Let $A$ be a commutative unital Banach algebra. Then $sigma(A)$ is a compact Hausdorff space.
]<compact-hausdorffness-of-spectrum>
#proof[
  Let $B$ be the closed unit ball of $(A', bar.v.double dot.op bar.v.double)$ where $bar.v.double dot.op bar.v.double$ is the operator norm. By the #link(<banach-alaoglu-theorem>)[Banach-Alaoglu theorem], $B$ is compact with respect to the weak$zws^*$ topology. According to the @properties-of-multiplicative-functionals, $sigma(A)$ is a subset of $B$. We need to show $sigma(A)$ is closed in $B$. Let $(h_n)_(n>=1)$ be a sequence in $sigma(A)$ such that
  $
    h_n -->^("w"^*) h
  $
  in $B$. For any $x , y in A$, we have
  $
    h(x y) = lim_(n arrow.r oo) h_n (x y) = lim_(n arrow.r oo) h_n (x) h_n (y) = h(x) h(y).
  $
  This implies $h in sigma(A)$. So $sigma(A)$ is a closed subset of $B$. Since closed subset of compact space is compact, $sigma(A)$ is compact. The Hausdorff property of $sigma(A)$ is inherited from $A'$, which is Hausdorff by @hausdorffness-of-weak-star-topology.

  + $overline(frak(a))$ is a proper ideal of $A$.

  + If $frak(a)$ is a maximal ideal, then $frak(a)$ is closed.
]<Banach-algebras-proper-ideals>
#proof[
  + This is a standard fact of ring theory.

  + According to standard fact of topological ring theory, $overline(frak(a))$ is a ideal of $A$. By @Banach-spaces-unit-group-is-open, $A-A^(times)$ is closed in $A$. Since $frak(a) subset.eq A-A^(times)$, we have $overline(frak(a)) subset.eq A-A^(times)$. So $overline(frak(a))$ is a proper ideal of $A$.

  + Suppose $frak(a)$ is a maximal ideal. By (ii) $overline(frak(a))$ is a proper ideal contains $frak(a)$. By the maximality of $frak(a)$, there must be $overline(frak(a)) = frak(a)$. So $frak(a)$ is closed.

#proposition[][
  Let $A$ be a commutative unital Banach algebra and $h in sigma(A)$. Then

  $
  is bijection.
]<bijection-between-spectrum-and-maximal-spectrum>
#proof[
  First we show $ker h$ is a maximal ideal of $A$. Since $h$ is a surjective ring homomorphism, by the first isomorphism theorem, $A \/ ker tilde.equiv h(A)=CC$. So $ker h$ is a maximal ideal of $A$.

  Next we show $ker$ is injective. Suppose $ker h_1 = ker h_2$ for some $h_1 , h_2 in sigma(A)$. Note that for any $x in A$,
  $
    h_1(x- h_1(x) 1_A) = h_1(x) - h_1(x) h_1(1_A) = 0.
  $
  So we get $x - h_1(x) 1_A in ker h_1= ker h_2$. Since $h_2(x - h_1(x) 1_A) = 0$, we have
  $
    h_2(x)=h_2(x - h_1(x) 1_A + h_1(x) 1_A) = h_1(x) h_2(1_A) = h_1(x).
  $
  This shows $ker$ is injective.

  Finally we show $ker$ is surjective. Let $frak(a)$ be a maximal ideal of $A$. By @Banach-algebras-proper-ideals, $frak(a)$ is closed. Therefore, $A \/ frak(a)$ is a Banach field. By the #link(<gelfand-mazur-theorem>)[Gelfand-Mazur theorem], $A \/ frak(a) equiv CC$. So there exists a isomorphism $psi : A \/ frak(a) ->^(tilde) CC$. Suppose $pi: A -> A \/ frak(a)$ is the canonical projection. Then $h = psi compose pi$ is a multiplicative functional on $A$ such that $ker h = frak(a)$.

            x & arrow.bar.long (hat(x):h arrow.bar.long h(x))
  $
  where $C(sigma(A))$ is the set of all continuous complex-valued functions on $sigma(A)$.
]
#remark[
  According to the @compact-hausdorffness-of-spectrum, $sigma(A)$ is a compact Hausdorff space. From @C_0-as-C-star-algebra we see $C(sigma(A))$ is a unital Banach algebra with respect to the supremum norm
  $
    norm(v)_sup = sup_(h in sigma(A)) |v(h)|, quad forall v in C(sigma(A)).
  $
  Now we can check that $Gamma_A$ is a unital Banach algebra homomorphism.

  + $Gamma_A$ preserves the multiplication: for any $x , y in A$ and $h in sigma(A)$, we have
    $
      (hat(x y))(h) = h(x y) = h(x) h(y) = hat(x)(h) hat(y)(h).
    $
    So $Gamma_A (x y)=hat(x y) = hat(x) hat(y)=Gamma_A (x)Gamma_A (y)$.

  + $Gamma_A$ preserves the unital element: for any $h in sigma(A)$, we have
    $
      hat(1_A)(h) = h(1_A) = 1.
    $
    So $Gamma_A (1_A) = hat(1_A)=1_(C(sigma(A)))$.

  + $Gamma_A$ is bounded: for any $x in A$ and $h in sigma(A)$, we have
    $
      |hat(x)(h)| = |h(x)| <= norm(x).
    $
    So for any $x in A$, we have $norm(hat(x))_(sup) <= norm(x)$, which implies
    $
      norm(Gamma_A)_(op("op")) = sup_(x in A \
      norm(x)_(A)<=1 ) norm(hat(x))_(sup) <= 1.
    $

  + $Gamma_A$ is $CC$-linear: for any $x , y in A$, $lambda in CC$ and $h in sigma(A)$, we have
    $
      (hat(lambda x + y))(h) = h(lambda x + y) = lambda h(x) + h(y) = lambda hat(x)(h) + hat(y)(h).
    $
    So $Gamma_A (lambda x + y) = lambda Gamma_A (x) + Gamma_A (y)$.

#proof[
  + Since

    we see $x in A^(times)$ $<==>$ $hat(x)$ never vanishes on $sigma(A)$.

    $
      rho(x) = sup_(lambda in sigma(x)) abs(lambda) = sup_(lambda in op("im") hat(x)) abs(lambda) = sup_(h in sigma(A)) abs(hat(x)(h))

#proof[
  + Let $mu$ be the counting measure on $G$. Given any $f in L^1(G)$, define
    $
      A_n:= {g in G mid(|) abs(f(g)) >= 1 / n}.
    $
    If $A_n$ is infinite, then we have $mu(A_n)=oo$ and
    $
      integral_(G) |f| dif mu >= integral_(A_n) |f| dif mu >= 1 / n mu(A_n) = oo,
    $
    contradicting $f in L^1(G)$. So $A_n$ is finite for all $n in ZZ_(>=1)$. This implies $op("supp") f = limits(union.big)_(n in ZZ_(>=1)) A_n$ is countable.

  + For any $f in L^1(G)$ and $epsilon > 0$, we can assume the support of $f$ is $op("supp") f = {g_n}_(n in ZZ_(>=1))$. Define $E_n={g_1,g_2,...,g_n}$, $G_n=op("supp") f-E_n$. Note that
    $
      f(a) - sum_(n=1)^(N) f(g_n) delta_(g_n)(a)= cases(
        gap: #0.9em,
        0 & " if" a in E_N,
        f(a) & " otherwise"
      ) quad = f(a)bold(1)_(G_N)(a).
    $
    As $N -> oo$, we have
    $
      norm(f - sum_(n=1)^(N) f(g_n) delta_(g_n))_(L^1(G)) = integral_(G) abs(f(a)bold(1)_(G_N)(a)) dif mu(a) = integral_(G_N) abs(f(a)) dif mu(a) --> 0.
    $

  + First we need to show $chi_h: g |-> h(delta_g)$ is a group homomorphism. Note
    $
      delta_(g_1) * delta_(g_2)(a)= sum_(x in G) delta_(g_1)(x) delta_(g_2)(x^(-1) a) = delta_(g_2)(g_1^(-1)a) = bold(1)_(g_1^(-1)a = g_2) = delta_(g_1 g_2)(a).
    $
    For any $g_1,g_2 in G$, we have
    $
      chi_h (g_1 g_2) = h(delta_(g_1 g_2)) = h(delta_(g_1)* delta_(g_2)) = h(delta_(g_1)) h(delta_(g_2)) = chi_h (g_1) chi_h (g_2).
    $
    Since $delta_(g) in L^1(G)^times$ for all $g in G$, by @properties-of-multiplicative-functionals we have $h(delta_(g)) in CC^times$. Thus $Phi(h)=chi_h in op("Hom")_(Grp)(G,CC^times)$.

    Next we show $Phi$ preserves multiplication. For any $h_1 , h_2 in sigma(L^1(G))$, we have
    $
      (Phi(h_1) Phi(h_2))(g) & = (chi_(h_1) chi_(h_2))(g)  \
                             & = chi_(h_1)(g) chi_(h_2)(g) \
                             & = h_1(delta_g) h_2(delta_g) \
                             & = (h_1 h_2)(delta_g)        \
                             & = Phi(h_1 h_2)(g).
    $
    To show $Phi$ is injective, suppose $h_1 , h_2 in sigma(L^1(G))$ such that $Phi(h_1) = Phi(h_2)$. Then for any $g in G$, we have
    $
      h_1(delta_g) = h_2(delta_g).
    $
    Since ${delta_g}_(g in G)$ spans a dense subspace of $L^1(G)$ and $h_1 , h_2$ are continuous, we have $h_1 = h_2$.

    Then we show $Phi$ is surjective. Let $chi in op("Hom")_(Grp)(G,CC^times)$. Define
    $
      h: L^1(G) & -->CC                                    \
              f & arrow.bar.long sum_(g in G) f(g) chi(g).
    $
    This is a multiplicative functional: for any $f_1, f_2 in L^1(G)$, we have
    $
      h(f_1 * f_2) & = sum_(g in G) (f_1 * f_2)(g) chi(g)                                            \
                   & = sum_(g in G) sum_(x in G) f_1(x) f_2(x^(-1) g) chi(g)                         \
                   & = sum_(x in G) sum_(y in x^(-1)G) f_1(x) f_2(y) chi(x y) quad("let" x^(-1) g=y) \
                   & =(sum_(x in G) f_1(x) chi(x))(sum_(y in G) f_2(y) chi(y))                       \
                   & = h(f_1) h(f_2).
    $
    So $h in sigma(L^1(G))$. For any $f in L^1(G)$ and $g in G$, we have
    $
      (Phi(h))(g)=h(delta_g) = sum_(x in G) delta_g (x) chi(x) = chi(g).
    $
    So $Phi(h) = chi$. This shows $Phi$ is surjective.

    Finally we show $Phi$ is continuous. For any net $(h_i)_(i in I)$ in $sigma(L^1(G))$ such that $h_i --> h$ in $sigma(L^1(G))$, we need to show $Phi(h_i) --> Phi(h)$ in $op("Hom")_(Grp)(G,CC^times)$. For any $g in G$, we have
    $
      abs((Phi(h_i) - Phi(h))(g)) = |chi_(h_i)(g) - chi_h(g)| = |h_i (delta_g) - h (delta_g)| --> 0.
    $
    This shows $Phi$ is continuous. We still need to show
    $
      Phi^(-1):op("Hom")_(Grp)(G,CC^times) & -->sigma(L^1(G))                                           \
                                       chi & arrow.bar.long (f arrow.bar.long sum_(g in G) f(g) chi(g))
    $

    is continuous. For any net $(chi_i)_(i in I)$ in $op("Hom")_(Grp)(G,CC^times)$ such that $chi_i --> chi$ in $op("Hom")_(Grp)(G,CC^times)$, we need to show $Phi^(-1)(chi_i) --> Phi^(-1)(chi)$ in $sigma(L^1(G))$. For any $f in L^1(G)$, we have
    $
      abs(Phi^(-1)(chi_i)(f) - Phi^(-1)(chi)(f)) &= abs(sum_(g in G) f(g) chi_i (g) - sum_(g in G) f(g) chi(g)) \
      &= abs(sum_(g in G) f(g) (chi_i (g) - chi(g))) <= norm(f) norm(chi_i - chi)_(op("op")) --> 0.
    $
    This shows $Phi^(-1)$ is continuous.
